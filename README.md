# Process

Wireframes were made on Figma and pages were implemented via HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

# Challenges & Wins

### Challenges

* Working with JS scripts
* Making sure the random fetch was only called once so that the corresponding data related to the hints, fun facts, and multiple choice answers were linked (we wouldn't want them to be from different countries).

### Wins

* We completed a functional MVP.
* Challenges were dealt with.
